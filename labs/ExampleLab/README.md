# Lab: Linux Connectivity Issue 01

## Scenario

You are a DevOps support engineer. A build pipeline is failing because the Linux build agent is unreachable. The environment was provisioned for youâ€”your job is to troubleshoot and resolve the connectivity issue using Azure tools (Portal or CLI). **Do not use Terraform to fix the problem.**

---

## Lab Setup

Follow these steps to set up your lab environment:

1. **Clone the repository and navigate to the base lab folder:**
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/tdevere/ADOLab_Networking.git
   cd ADOLab_Networking/labs/base_lab
   ```
2. **Initialize Terraform:**
   ```powershell
   terraform init
   ```
3. **Plan and apply with scenario variables:**
   ```powershell
   $sshkey = Get-Content $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\terraform_lab_key.pub
   terraform plan -var-file="../Linux_Connectivity_Issue_01/scenario.tfvars" -var="admin_ssh_key=$sshkey" -out=tfplan
   terraform apply tfplan
   ```
4. **Obtain the Linux agent VM details:**
   - Use the Azure Portal or CLI to find the VM and its networking configuration.


## Example Symptoms (Sample Data)

- Azure DevOps pipeline fails with error:
  > Example error: Agent unreachable: SSH connection timed out
- You cannot SSH to the Linux agent using its public IP (e.g., 52.160.10.123).
- The agent does not appear online in the Azure DevOps agent pool (pool: ExamplePool).

*Note: These are example symptoms for demonstration purposes only.*

## Example Tasks (Sample Data)

1. Attempt to SSH to the agent using the public IP (e.g., `52.160.10.123`).
2. Check the VM's networking configuration in the Azure Portal (VM name: `example-agent-vm`).
3. Use Azure CLI or Portal to verify if the public IP is attached and enabled (resource group: `example-rg`).
4. Re-enable or re-attach the public IP using Azure Portal or CLI if needed.
5. Confirm the agent is reachable via SSH and appears online in the DevOps agent pool (pool: `ExamplePool`).
6. Document your troubleshooting steps and resolution (screenshots, CLI output, etc.).

*Note: These are example tasks for demonstration purposes only. Replace with your actual lab steps as needed.*

## Your Tasks (Examples)

1. **Deploy the Example Lab**
   - Use Terraform to provision the lab resources as described above.
   - Supply scenario variables as needed.

2. **Validate Resource Creation**
   - Confirm that the agent VM, networking, and Key Vault resources are created successfully.
   - Use Terraform outputs and the Azure Portal to inspect resource properties.

3. **Document Your Results**
   - List the steps you performed to deploy and validate the lab.
   - Optionally include screenshots or CLI output showing the resources.

## Detailed Troubleshooting Steps


## Example Validation Steps

1. **Check Terraform Outputs**
   - After `terraform apply`, review the outputs for VM public IP, Key Vault private endpoint, and DNS records.

2. **Inspect Resources in Azure Portal**
   - Confirm the agent VM, networking, and Key Vault resources exist and match your scenario variables.

3. **Test SSH Connectivity (Optional)**
   - If a public IP is provisioned, try:
     ```bash
     ssh -i ~/.ssh/terraform_lab_key azureuser@$(terraform output -raw agent_vm_public_ip)
     ```

4. **Document Your Results**
   - List the steps you performed and any outputs or screenshots that validate the lab deployment.

## Restoring to the Base Lab Version

After completing this example lab, you can restore your environment to the original base_lab version:

1. Change to the base lab directory:
   ```powershell
   cd ../base_lab
   ```
2. Re-apply the base lab configuration:
   ```powershell
   $sshkey = Get-Content $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\terraform_lab_key.pub
   terraform plan -var-file="terraform.tfvars" -var="admin_ssh_key=$sshkey" -out=tfplan
   terraform apply tfplan
   ```
3. This will reset your environment to the base lab state.

## Notes
- Do not use Terraform to fix the issue. The lab simulates a real-world operational scenario.
- If you need to roll back, contact your instructor or use provided rollback instructions.
