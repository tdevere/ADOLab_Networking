# Lab: Linux Connectivity Issue 01

## Scenario

You are a DevOps support engineer. A build pipeline is failing because the Linux build agent is unreachable. The environment was provisioned for youâ€”your job is to troubleshoot and resolve the connectivity issue using Azure tools (Portal or CLI). **Do not use Terraform to fix the problem.**

---

## Lab Setup

Follow these steps to set up your lab environment:

1. **Clone the repository and navigate to the lab folder:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tdevere/ADOLab_Networking.git
   cd ADOLab_Networking/lab/Labs/Linux_Connectivity_Issue_01
   ```
2. **Initialize Terraform:**
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
3. **Create a workspace for this lab:**
   ```bash
   terraform workspace new linux_connectivity_issue_01
   ```
4. **Apply the lab configuration:**
   ```bash
   terraform plan -var-file="../../terraform/terraform.tfvars.example"
   terraform apply -var-file="../../terraform/terraform.tfvars.example" -auto-approve
   ```
5. **Obtain the Linux agent VM details:**
   - Use the Azure Portal or CLI to find the VM and its networking configuration.

---

## Symptoms

- Azure DevOps pipeline fails with error:
  > Agent unreachable: SSH connection timed out
- You cannot SSH to the Linux agent using its public IP.
- The agent does not appear online in the Azure DevOps agent pool.

---

## Your Tasks

1. **Diagnose the Issue**
   - Attempt to SSH to the agent using the public IP (provided in the outputs or portal).
   - Check the VM's networking configuration in the Azure Portal.
   - Use Azure CLI or Portal to verify if the public IP is attached and enabled.

2. **Resolve the Issue**
   - Re-enable or re-attach the public IP to the Linux agent VM using the Azure Portal or CLI.
   - Confirm that the agent is reachable via SSH and appears online in the DevOps agent pool.

3. **Document Your Steps**
   - List the troubleshooting steps you performed.
   - Include screenshots or CLI output showing the resolution.

## Detailed Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Attempt SSH Connection

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/terraform_lab_key azureuser@<linux-agent-public-ip>
```

If you receive a timeout or connection refused, proceed to the next step.

### 2. Check VM Networking in Azure Portal

- Go to the Azure Portal > Virtual Machines > [Your Linux Agent VM].
- Under **Networking**, verify if a public IP address is listed and attached to the network interface.
- If no public IP is present, this is likely the cause of the connectivity issue.

### 3. Use Azure CLI to Check Public IP

```bash
az vm show -g <resource-group> -n <linux-agent-vm-name> --query "networkProfile.networkInterfaces" -o json
```
Or list public IPs in the resource group:
```bash
az network public-ip list -g <resource-group> -o table
```

### 4. Re-enable or Attach Public IP

**Azure Portal:**
- Go to the VM's **Networking** blade.
- Click on the network interface.
- Under **IP configurations**, add or enable a public IP address.
- Save changes.

**Azure CLI:**
Attach a public IP to the VM's NIC:
```bash
az network nic ip-config update --resource-group <resource-group> --nic-name <nic-name> --name <ip-config-name> --public-ip-address <public-ip-name>
```

### 5. Verify SSH and Agent Pool Status

- Try SSH again:
  ```bash
  ssh -i ~/.ssh/terraform_lab_key azureuser@<linux-agent-public-ip>
  ```
- Check the agent status in Azure DevOps agent pool.

### 6. Document Your Resolution

- List the steps you performed.
- Include screenshots or CLI output showing the VM's networking before and after the fix.
- Note the agent's status in Azure DevOps after resolution.

---

## Notes

- **Do not use Terraform to fix the issue.** The lab is designed to simulate a real-world scenario where you must use Azure operational tools.
- If you need to roll back, contact your instructor or use the provided rollback instructions (if any).

## Example Error Message

```
##[error]The agent is not responding. Check network connectivity and firewall settings.
